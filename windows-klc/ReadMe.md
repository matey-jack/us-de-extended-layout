Main files in this folder:
 - [usintl48](usintl48) -- this folder contains the compiled layout (described in main ReadMe) that you can install in Windows.
 - [US extended international for 48 keys.klc](US%20extended%20international%20for%2048%20keys.klc) -- source code for the layout.
   You can load it into MS Keyboard Layout Creator and compile it yourself to the installable layout.

Some additional files in this folder:
 - [US extended international.klc](US%20extended%20international.klc) -- layout saved from the Windows onboard "US extended international".
  This is the basis for the custom layout, and you diff the files to see what exactly I modified.
 - [DE ext 1.klc](DE%20ext%201.klc) -- layout saved from the Windows onboard "Deutsch (erweitert 1)". 
   Only here for reference to check how things are done in this layout.
 - [US ANSI German.klc](US%20ANSI%20German.klc) -- experiment trying to get to a similar layout as the intl48, 
   but putting German Umlauts on the base layer instead leaving them on their existing AltGr positions.
   This layout looks more like the total result that I want to get (when combined with keyboard firmware layout),
   but it has the drawback that the firmware is harder to program, as we can't use standard key labels as a reference.
